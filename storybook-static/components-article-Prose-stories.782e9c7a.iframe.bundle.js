Now let\'s see what a more complex list would\n        look like.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>\n              I often do this thing where list items have headings.\n            </strong>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because\n            it\'s pretty annoying to get the styles right.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so\n            the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list\n            item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty\n            tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just\n            shouldn\'t write this way.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Since this is a list, I need at least two items.</strong>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I explained what I\'m doing already in the previous list item, but a\n            list wouldn\'t be a list if it only had one item, and we really want\n            this to look realistic. That\'s why I\'ve added this second list item\n            so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            <strong>It\'s not a bad idea to add a third item either.</strong>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I think it probably would\'ve been fine to just use two items but\n            three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no\n            trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include\n            it.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        After this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph,\n        because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Code should look okay by default.</h2>\n      <p>\n        I think most people are going to use{" "}\n        <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> or{" "}\n        <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> or something if they want to\n        style their code blocks but it wouldn\'t hurt to make them look{" "}\n        <em>okay</em> out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Here\'s what a default <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file looks like at\n        the time of writing:\n      </p>\n      <p>Hopefully that looks good enough to you.</p>\n      <h3>What about nested lists?</h3>\n      <p>\n        Nested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium\n        don\'t even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are\n        going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Nested lists are rarely a good idea.</strong>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              You might feel like you are being really "organized" or something\n              but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard\n              to read.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as\n              possible.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Since we need to have more items, here\'s another one.</strong>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              I\'m not sure if we\'ll bother styling more than two levels deep.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.\n            </li>\n            <li>If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Two items isn\'t really a list, three is good though.</strong>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Again please don\'t nest lists if you want people to actually read\n              your content.\n            </li>\n            <li>Nobody wants to look at this.</li>\n            <li>I\'m upset that we even have to bother styling this.</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n        The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that{" "}\n        <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements aren\'t given a child{" "}\n        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the\n        list item.
